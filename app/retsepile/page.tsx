                    <CardDescription>
                    I used to think I was too smart for anything outside of IT (Information Technology). I figured all I needed to do was dive into programming and become the best at it. So, I spent my younger years buried in programming books, hitting the library with friends like Relebohile and Kabelo â€“ Kabelo, being a year ahead, dragged me into the world of Java even when I was still in primary school. Meanwhile, my brother Tello was already studying computer science at university, showing off his latest projects whenever he came home. Inspired by them, I decided to focus solely on becoming the best software engineer.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This approach worked well for me in high school, although my grades suffered a bit because I was splitting my attention between coding and academics. I learned how to balance both, which came in handy later in life. I became pretty skilled at coding over the years, sacrificing some grades but still managing to keep both areas afloat, albeit with a few hiccups. Meanwhile, my friends Khotso, Mabula, and Joe were excelling academically, with some even getting opportunities to study abroad â€“ something we all dreamed of.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Fast forward to university (Limkokwing), and I found an environment that suited me perfectly â€“ no more juggling between coding and other subjects, it was all about tech, all the time. I even dabbled in subjects like Business Management, which I initially overlooked but later realized was essential for my entrepreneurial aspirations. Business? Easy. Find something, sell it, make money. Why complicate it?
                    <br/><br/>
                    To cut a long story short, I graduated as an improved version of myself, with a few lessons learned from my brothers along the way. My grades were decent, and I sailed through university without even glancing at the cheating playbook â€“ unlike many others who treated it like their bible. I opted out of that game, still aced exams, and even received some shiny awards at graduation. But trust me, that&apos;s just scratching the surface, especially if you&apos;re aiming to build a business empire instead of just working for someone else.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I could create amazing software solutions but struggled to sell them. Why? Well, for starters, I lacked the right audience. Plus, I&apos;m a hardcore introvert who&apos;d rather endure a root canal than engage in small talk. Texting? Let&apos; s not even go there â€“ my replies are as short and chilly as an Antarctic breeze, even though I mean well. And committing to a text conversation? About as likely as finding a unicorn in my backyard. Social media? Not my thing. And to top it all off, my network is as thin as a single LEGO block. It&apos;s just me and my code, navigating the digital world solo.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This is why I had to start blogging. Because when you&apos;re building, it has to be done in public. You need to be posting, building, publishing, launching. Why? Because you need data.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I refuse to be a starving artist, creating what I think is valuable, only to become attached to my version of value and wonder why I&apos;m not selling. &apos;But I created a beautiful painting,&apos; you might say. That&apos;s all well and good if you&apos;re content being a hobbyist. But if you want a career out of it, you&apos;re going to have to play a back-and-forth game with the market.

                          Whats crazy is the extension of our personal and collective minds, us putting out ideas (Ridic Originals, Nucleus Creative Studio) beliefs and opinions that form a digital society, culture(Daeman.) and the world. 
                          This is a psychedelic collection of consciousness.
